## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is a Software Engineer, Rose Wang. Here is a little about me...

ðŸŒŸ Passionate and results-oriented software engineer with a strong foundation in computer science and a proven track record of driving impactful projects.

ðŸš€ During my recent technical internship at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I had the opportunity to refine my skills in team coordination, problem-solving, and rapid language acquisition. For instance, I developed a Python script that not only automated tedious search tasks but also streamlined the integration of search results into Excel, demonstrating my ability to innovate and deliver practical solutions.

ðŸ’¡ With a solid proficiency in languages such as C++, Java, and Python, coupled with expertise in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, I excel in crafting robust applications and user-friendly interfaces. My experience spans various projects, from developing task management web applications to designing customer-friendly interfaces for dessert shops and building interactive e-commerce websites from scratch.

ðŸŽ¯ Beyond technical expertise, I am committed to continuous learning and growth. I hold a degree in Computer Science from Ensign College, where I maintained a stellar GPA of 3.9/4.0. Additionally, my experience as a translator for ancient Chinese texts at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints honed my attention to detail and ability to communicate effectively across languages and cultures.
